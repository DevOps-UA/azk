### A development environment orchestrator tool

`azk` lets web developers easily and quickly to create, maintain and isolate their development environments through automation, in a powerful yet flexible way.

## Quick start

### Installing

**tl;dr;**

```
$ curl -Ls http://azk.io/install.sh | bash
```

#### Mac OS X

**Requirements:** [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), version 4.3.6+

```
brew install azukiapp/azk/azk
```

#### Linux

For Linux instructions see the [docs](http://docs.azk.io/en/installation/linux.html).

### Using `azk`

#### Using `azk` in a brand new project

If you are starting a new application project, you can already use `azk` to obtain the proper runtime as well the corresponding generators for your chosen language and then generate the application's basic structure. An example in Node.js would look like this:

```bash
$ cd ~/projects
$ azk shell --image azukiapp/node # obtaining the runtime
    # mkdir app-name
    # npm init                    # building the application's basic structure
    ...
    # exit
$ cd app-name
$ azk init
azk: `node` system was detected at 'app-name'
azk: 'Azkfile.js' generated

$ azk start
```

#### Using `azk` with an existing project

When you have an application project that's already started, and want to use `azk` to streamline its development environment, all you have to do is:

```bash
$ cd [my_application_folder]
$ azk init
azk: 'Azkfile.js' generated
...
$ azk start
```

## Main features

* Multiplatform: Works both on Linux & Mac OS X (requires 64-bit platform)
* Images: via [azk images][azk_images] or [Docker Registry][docker_registry]
* Built in load-balancer
* Built in file sync
* Automatic start-up (and reload) script
* Logging
* And simple and easy to use DSL to describe its architecture

## Documentation

You can find our documentation online at: http://docs.azk.io/

### Basic Vocabulary

#### System of Systems

`azk` is based on the concept of [System of Systems][sos]. Accordingly, applications (your code), services and workers (such as databases, webservers and queue systems) are treated as systems that communicate with each other and together make the primary system. Using this paradigm, `azk` installs and manages development environments. While this may seem overkill at first, it actually makes it a lot easier to manage the development and execution environments of an application (in its parts - the "systems" - or in its entirety - the full "system of systems").

#### Images

In order to automate the provisioning of development environments, `azk` uses pre-built custom images. These images follow the [Docker][docker] standard and can be found in: [azk images][azk_images], [Docker Index][docker_index] or [Dockerfile][dockerfile].

#### Azkfile.js

`Azkfile.js` files are the cornerstone of how to use `azk`. These simple manifest files describe the systems that make your system of systems as well as the images used in their execution. They also describe parameters and execution options.
