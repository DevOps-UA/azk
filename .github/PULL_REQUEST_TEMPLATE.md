Hi. We've set up a few optional questions to help you to structure your PR.
It would also help us to assist you more quickly and efficiently.

We strongly recommend you to write your message in English for 2 main reasons:

1. Your improvement can fit others' needs;
2. Makes it easier for our community users to help each others out;

There are two types of templates you can use:
---------------------------------------------------------

A. If it's a work in progress

1. What is this PR objective?

2. Tasklist

- [ ] Task one

---------------------------------------------------------

B. If it's a finished PR

1. What is this PR objective?

[What is this solving or implementing?]

2. How did you tackle the issue?

[Write in details your decisions/perceptions and how you accomplished this]
