# Starting an application from scratch

Let's say you want to start a new project using a language or framework that you don't have installed in your machine. How do you do that?

One of the advantages of using `azk` is that you don't need a specific language or framework installed in your machine. But some frameworks have commands that help you start a project from scratch. An easy way to use those commands is to start a container that already has the command you need, create the project, and then exit the container.

Here's a few getting started guides for different languages/frameworks:

- [Node.js](nodejs.md)
- [Rails](rails.md)
- [Django](django.md)
- [Laravel](laravel.md)
