# Terms of Use

Using `azk`, command line interface tool, implies in the acceptance of the terms below.

Azuki (the company that created and maintains `azk`) wishes to obtain your permission to collect certain usage data.

These terms describe the motivation to collect that data as well as list the data to be collected and how it will be treated.

These terms can be altered without any notice, which you accept with continued use of `azk`.

## Motivation

The collected data will be mainly employed for the purposes below:

+ Detection of hardware and software configurations in which `azk` is used as well as their recurrence;
+ Detection and prioritization (by recurrence) of internal errors to be corrected in `azk`;
+ Inference and prioritization of new features to be added to future versions of `azk`.

## Modalities

Data collection is automatic and ongoing.

There are two kinds of data collection: anonymous and non-anonymous.

In the first case, no personally identifiable information will be collected or associated to the corresponding usage data set collected.

In the second case, users will have the option to inform an e-mail address to be associtated to their usage data set collected.

This e-mail address will be used for support purposes (Azuki may send solutions to automatically reported errors in `azk` even if users don't ever request them).

By informing an e-mail address, you assume to be the owner of that e-mail, to have access to its inbox and the authorization for Azuki to send it solutions to the errors reported by `azk`.

Data collection is optional.

When using `azk` for the first time (version 0.17.0 or higher), every user must accept these Terms of Use. `azk` won't start completely till users accept them.

Then, at this point, data collection will be activated by default.

When the first error take place, you'll be informed and asked to inform your e-mail if you wish to do so.

Any of these choices can be reverted at any time. Check [these instructions](http://docs.azk.io/en/reference/cli/config.html) to learn how.

## Collected Data

**Remember:** `azk` is open source software and thus it can be easily verified by any person or entity to confirm the veracity of the list below as well as the information on the last topic ("Modalities") without any permission from Azuki or any other party.

No personally identifiable information will ever be shared by Azuki with third parties without previous user authorization.
